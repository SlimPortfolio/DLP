            <span class="caption">I first learned music when I was 4 or 5 years old. My mom is a Piano teacher and started me off when I was 4 or 5 years old. From there, I started violin lessons and ended up playing in school orchestras and concerts for more than 6 years. I developed my passion for music when I taught myself how to play guitar in middle school to serve on church worship bands and praise teams.</span>

            <span class="caption">Growing up, music was never my favorite thing. I grew up doing Piano and Violin lessons just like my siblings, but I didn't start to enjoy music for myself until I started taking guitar lessons in high school. Now I currently serve at my church leading worship on Sundays and have also led at different camps, events, and retreats.</span>
